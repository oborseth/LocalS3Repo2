### LocalSettings.php ###

Below are 2 versions of what should be added to the bottom of your LocalSettings file. Believe the first one will work from v1.21 onwards as much as the second one, as well as the code it is attached to. This repository should be tagged if not.

```php
/*
	Modified to work with 1.25.
	Antony D'Andrea - contactme at antonydandrea dot com

        This also has a couple of bug fixes on the code, but the config below
        along with the bug fixes definitely works in MediaWiki 1.25.
